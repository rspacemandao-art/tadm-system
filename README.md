# TADM System
**Tactile-Auditory Descriptive Mapping**

A cognitive translation system converting visually-dependent language into accessible multi-sensory experiences while preserving semantic and emotional meaning.

---

## Overview

TADM addresses a critical gap in accessibility technology by translating visual content for blind and visually impaired users while maintaining the full emotional, narrative, and contextual richness of the original material.

Unlike existing assistive technologies that mechanically convert text to speech or braille, TADM uses the Visual Word Scaffold (VWS) algorithm to perform cognitive translation—preserving meaning across sensory modalities through spatial audio, haptic feedback, and thermal mapping.

## Core Innovation

The VWS algorithm identifies visually-dependent language in text and translates it into structured spatial-emotional descriptors. This preserves not just information, but the complete semantic experience—emotion, atmosphere, narrative structure, and cultural context.

## Current Status

Phase I development with community validation framework established through partnerships with accessibility organizations. Technical architecture documented and ready for implementation.

## Applications

- Literary content
- Educational materials  
- Professional documentation
- Instructional text
- Any content containing visually-dependent language
