# TADM System
**Tactile-Auditory Descriptive Mapping**

TADM ingests literary and informational text and translates visually dependent language into non-visual, sensory-agnostic descriptive text.
---

## Overview

TADM is an open translation protocol focused on removing visually dependent assumtpions from written language at the semantic level. Rather than adapting visual content into alternative sensory formats, TADM restructures text itself so that meaning remains intact without requiring visual reference.

The protocol operates on literary and informational text, identifying language that relies on visual cues,spatial metaphors, layout assumptions, or implied sight-based context.

These elements are translated into non-visual, sensory-agnostic descriptive text that preserves intent, structure, and narrative continuity.

TADM outputs plain text designed to be interpretable across multiple reading modalities, including screen readers, refreshable braille displays (RBDs), and standard text interfaces. The project is currently in active research and validation, with emphasis on community-reviewed accuracy and contextual fidelity. 

## Core Innovation

TADM identifies visually dependent language patterns in text and translates them into descriptive, non-visual expressions that preserve semantic meaning, narrative flow, and contextual nuance.

This approach prioritizes interpretability over sensory simulation, ensuring that translated text remains usable across diverse reading modalities. 

## Current Status

Phase I development with community validation framework established through partnerships with accessibility organizations. Technical architecture documented and ready for implementation.

## Applications

- Literary content
- Educational materials  
- Professional documentation
- Instructional text
- Any content containing visually-dependent language
